### Introduction

I am a systems engineer and an adjunct professor of data science. As I cover concepts in data science (or learn new ones), I have been writing code, mostly in R but sometimes in Python, to demonstrate to my classes or better learn certain techniques. I am establishing this blog so I can post code and material.

### Bio

He has over 26 years of experience working in software and systems engineering with the first ten years of his career as a "systems analyst" (what we would now call "data scientist") at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA] (https://www.bea.gov). His research interests include system of systems and complex systems modeling. He holds a BA degree in Mathematics from Rutgers University, a MS degree in Information Systems from Johns Hopkins University, and a PhD in Systems Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology.

### Jekyll Theme

This blog site was originally based on the Travelog Theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) that is both elegant and downright simple. The theme source code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/rowanoulton/travelog-theme). If you'd like to throw me a shoutout or say thanks to the theme developer, he is on [@rowanoulton](https://twitter.com/rowanoulton/).
