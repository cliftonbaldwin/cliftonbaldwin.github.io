# Introduction to my Blog
This data science blog is built on the Jekyll Travelog theme (both elegant and downright simple). The theme source code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/rowanoulton/travelog-theme).

## Introduction
I am a systems engineer and an adjunct professor of data science. As I cover concepts in data science (or learn new ones), I have been writing code, mostly in R but sometimes in Python, to demonstrate to my classes or better learn certain techniques. I am establishing this blog so I can post code and material.

## Bio
Dr. Clifton Baldwin is an adjunct professor for the Data Science and Strategic Analytics Masters degree, Stockton University, Galloway, NJ, a program he helped establish. In addition, Dr. Baldwin is the Southern New Jersey Regional Director for the Delaware Valley Chapter of INCOSE
[INCOSE](http://www.incose.org). He has over 26 years of experience working in software and systems engineering with the first ten years of his career as a "systems analyst" (what we would now call "data scientist") at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA] (https://www.bea.gov). His research interests include system of systems and complex systems modeling. He holds a BA degree in Mathematics from Rutgers University, a MS degree in Information Systems from Johns Hopkins University, and a PhD in Systems Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology.
