The *Stockton DSSA* class walked to the local cemetery to collect data on October 31, 2017. Each team of students uploaded their data, in whatever format they used. An optional project was to read in the various datasets, clean them as needed, and analyze the data. Not many of the students undertook this project, but I decided it was a good opportunity for me to play with the data and use my findings as an example for the class. 

Although I am posting this blog post in March 2018, I dated it November 2017, when I wrote the code and did the analysis.

Here is my R Notebook:
